                    <p class="lead">Bruno's favorite thing to do is curl up in the sun, or assume his frog position, and take a nice nap in the sunlight, usually accompanied by his favorite person Morgan. He's always ecstatic to be taken on an adventure whether it's an off-leash walk in the woods, getting a trip to the dog park to make new friends, a plain old walk to sniff new things, or just playing fetch in the backyard with his siblings.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Bruno has quite a few toys he really enjoys. He is a big fan of the Kong brand, particularly the rubber toys like the Classic dog toy, especially when it's full of peanut butter, and the plush toys with squeakers in them that he can rip open and pull out! He also enjoys rope toys that he can play tug of war with. He's also a classic tennis ball enthusiast with the occasional baseball here and there.</p>

                    <h2>Adoption Story</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Bruno has a very simple, but sweet adoption story. He is a rescue from Georgia that was transported from Georgia to Virginia when he was around 9-12 months old. His gotcha day is in May; he was a sight unseen adoption, although we did have 2 weeks to decide if he was a keeper, which we did not need to decide—he was meant to be a part of the family. We gave him a June birthday and celebrated his first birthday a month after getting him. We showered him with love and treats; he put on some weight, learned some tricks, and 4 years later, he's as happy as can be.</p>
